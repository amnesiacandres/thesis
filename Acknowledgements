I want to acknowledge

Mariana, for giving unconditional love and support, and having the courage to undergo and surpass all the difficulties arised from my scientific endeavour.

Andres and Catalina, for being an unfinishing source of energy and providing the strongest motivation I could need to close my books after a day of work.

My parents, for being exemplary models, and providing advise and guidance to maintain the family as pillar of personal and intellectual development.

Jose Tamez and Victor Trevino,

Fellow researchers at the Bioinformatics research group: Antonio, Hugo, Raul, Emmanuel, Jose Maria, Jorge for all the hours dedicated to discuss scopes and results of my research, and all the hours dedicated to forget just that.

Magaly Garza, Servando Cardona, and the Breast Imaging Center

The anonymous patients that gave their consent to use their valuable information in form of clinical records, images, and biopsy samples, without which this work would not have been possible.

This constitutes the doctoral dissertation of Juan Rodriguez, presented at Tecnologico de Monterrey as a partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of doctor in philosophy.
The work behind this dissertation was done between January 2010 and May 2014 under the supervision of professors Dr. Jose Gerardo Tamez Pena and Dr. Victor Manuel Trevino Alvarado.
This work was possible due to a collaboration with the Breast Imaging Center at Hospital San Jose Tec de Monterrey, in Monterrey (Mexico). Funds were provided by institutional resources, and CONACYT grant XXXX.
The primary goal of this dissertation is to investigate the automatic characterization of breast tissue under x-ray mammography, and its relation with breast cancer outcomes, clinical endpoints, and molecular states. Such characterization would provide diagnostic tools of clinical interest, and eventually improve detection of breast cancer and lower mortality rates of such disease.

\begin_layout Standard
Digital analysis of mammograms has been a matter of study for more than
 three decades.
 During this period, the scope of the principal trend of research in the
 area has shifted in multiple occasions to provide the solutions required
 by radiologists.
 In the decade of the 1980's, the few researchers with the technological
 infrastructure necessary for digital analysis of images developed contrast
 enhancement methods that would allow radiologists a better visualization
 of subtle lesions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As contrast enhancement provided small practical value, the research interest
 quickly shifted towards the characterization of commonly seen lesions,
 especially micro calcifications (MCC).
 MCC detection and characterization is a matter of interest to the date,
 however, the amount of breast cancer cases in which MCC are hard to detect
 by a radiologist are barely none.
 Additionally, it is often found that MCC never evolve into cancer.
 In consequence, MCC characterization gives little value to the radiologists
 in most cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Masses are better associated to breast cancer than MCC, but in early stages
 of cancer their appearance is subtle and hard to detect even by trained
 radiologists.
 Evidently, the automated identification and characterization of masses
 in mammograms would provide
